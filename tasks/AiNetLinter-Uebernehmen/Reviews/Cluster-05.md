# Cluster 5 Review Log

## Point 5.1 implementation

- Base commit: `76d1252519214e317e5f77d3472b5163c231d06d`; the working tree was clean before this implementation slice.
- Read-only AiNetLinter comparison covered `CallGraphTreeBuilder`, `OutgoingCallScanner`, the override-declaration filter, the ASCII/Mermaid renderers, and `CallGraphTraversalTests`. AiNetLinter includes constructor/object-creation and member-access targets, clamps `topN` to at least one, enforces its graph node cap, excludes BCL symbols by default, excludes override declarations from incoming edges, and sanitizes Mermaid line breaks and quotes.
- Before-fix regressions failed for outgoing object creation/member access, `TopN=0`, Mermaid label newlines, and null public inputs (which leaked `NullReferenceException`). A high-fan-out regression was added with `TopN` above the 250-node cap.
- The Core builder now resolves explicit and target-typed object creation and non-invoked member access, displays constructor targets by containing type, clamps `TopN` to one, and refuses to add nodes beyond 250 while reporting hidden edges and truncation. The Mermaid renderer replaces CR/LF and quotes in labels. Builder and renderers validate null required inputs. The tests also verify source `h:` handoffs in call-tree output and that an override declaration is not emitted as an incoming caller.
- Added the current-state page [Call Tree Core Engine](../../../docs/navigation/get-call-tree.md) and indexed it in `docs/README.md`. It describes the Core engine only; public MCP tool transport remains for later integration work.
- The 5.1 audit checkbox remains `[ ]`. This implementation record is not an independent audit; the requested point audit is still pending.
